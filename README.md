# Dice Bot

This is a project from October 2019 for use in a Discord server I was in, when we wanted to play certain specific games over the phone. As such, it isn't very good at it's job, since I built this when I was still a Freshman at college, but I think it's important to always document the past, and give these projects a home.

This was built using Discord.js, and was deployed using Heroku. As I am unwilling to pay for Heroku, towards the end of every month, the bot goes offline and I have to run it via the command line if I want it to work.
